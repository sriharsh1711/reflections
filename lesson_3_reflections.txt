When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This is helpful when more than one person is contributing to a project. Also this helpful if you someone to review our code.
It comes handy when you work on different computers and to keep all the workstations in sync.

Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote respository?
When multiple people are collabrating on a project you might not want changes made by other people in your local repository.
