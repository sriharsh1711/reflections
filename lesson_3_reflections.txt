When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This is helpful when more than one person is contributing to a project. Also this helpful if you someone to review our code.
It comes handy when you work on different computers and to keep all the workstations in sync.

Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote respository?
When multiple people are collabrating on a project you might not want changes made by other people in your local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of last known state of the remote stored locally?
when you collabrate with others on a project and all the changes made in the remote can be  pulled without loss of any changes made in the local using git fetch and then 
comparing the changes and then merging them.
